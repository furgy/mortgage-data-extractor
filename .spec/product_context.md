# Product Context

## Purpose
The **Real Estate Financial Reconciliation Engine** (formerly Mortgage Data Extractor) is a high-integrity tool designed to audit and synchronize real estate financial data across multiple platforms. It transitions the project from simple data conversion to a proactive "Automated Auditor" role.

## Problems Solved
-   **Manual Data Entry**: Automates extraction from banking and property management statements.
-   **Lack of Trust in Data**: Resolves discrepancies between Property Manager reports and the Stessa "Source of Truth," giving investors confidence in performance metrics.
-   **Tax Preparation Stress**: Shifts from end-of-year clean-up to a continuous monthly reconciliation workflow.
-   **Complex Data Mapping**: Automates sign inversion, GL account mapping, and exclusion of transactions (like security deposits) that shouldn't be on the owner's books.

## Target Audience
The primary user is the property owner (Shawn) who manages multiple properties and uses Stessa for financial tracking.
