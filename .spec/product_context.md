# Product Context

## Purpose
The **Mortgage Data Extractor & Stessa Mapper** was created to solve two manual financial tasks for a real estate owner:
1.  **Mortgage Statements**: Manually extracting principal, interest, and escrow breakdowns from monthly Huntington and PNC PDF statements and formatting them for Stessa.
2.  **Property Management Logs**: Mapping transaction dumps from "Property Boss" to appropriate Stessa sub-categories and formatting them for a clean import.

## Problems Solved
-   **Manual Data Entry**: Eliminates the error-prone process of copying numbers from PDFs.
-   **Category Fragmentation**: Standardizes disparate GL accounts from Property Boss into a single Stessa-compatible taxonomy.
-   **Inconsistent Formatting**: Ensures all imports follow the exact schema, sign conventions, and property naming requirements of the Stessa platform.

## Target Audience
The primary user is the property owner (Shawn) who manages multiple properties and uses Stessa for financial tracking.
